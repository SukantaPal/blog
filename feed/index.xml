<p>But some pandal or Puja Committee hold this puja as well because it’s a few days after Durga puja, they do the puja in the same pandal where Durga idol was there. Even they bought idols at the same time when they bought the Durga idol and extra ordered for the Laxmi idol too. In the same pandal, they worshipped Laxmi Puja on a very small scale. This way they do two pujas back to back one is Durga Puja and another is Laxmi Puja (The day of Laxmi Puja Kolkata 20th Oct 2021).<strong> দুগ্গা দুগ্গা করে লক্ষ্মী এলো ঘরে</strong> (Dugga Dugga kore lakkhi Elo Ghore) be like. This Laxmi Puja Kolkata, Kojagori Lakshmi Puja or Lakhi puja whatever name you call it, it’s actually followed by a diverse community of Kolkata. Bengali family hold this Puja called or referred to as <strong>Kojagori Laxmi Puja</strong>. Other communities hold as Laxmi Puja. These Puja attractions are Alpona given by women (anyone), Preparing Bhog like <strong>Naru (Sweets made of Coconut)</strong>, Sinni, Murki, Chire and many other delicious food items. Lakshmi Pooja happens in the evening (Sharad Purnima) followed by Conch Sounds and reciting Lakshmi Pacnachli. </p>

<p><strong>Sharad Purnima</strong> (also known as Kumara Purnima(କୁମାର ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣିମା ), Kojagiri Purnima, Navanna Purnima, or Kaumudi Purnima is a harvest festival celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu lunar month of Ashvin (September to October), marking the end of the monsoon season. On this auspicious day, many divine pairs like Radha Krishna, Shiva Parvati, and Lakshmi Narayan are worshipped along with the moon and are offered flowers and kheer (sweet dish made of rice and milk). Deities in temples are usually dressed in white colour signifying the brightness of the moon. Many people observe full day fasting on this day. This day is celebrated differently in different parts of the country. In Odisha, on this day unmarried women keep fast with the popular belief of getting their suitable groom(kumara). This festival starts with maidens welcoming the sun god just at sunrise with a coconut-leaf-made-vessel called &#8216;kula&#8217; filled with fried paddy containing 7 fruits like coconut, banana, cucumber, betel nut, sugar-cane, guava followed by &#8216;Aarti&#8217;. In the evening they break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy of the morning along with the fruits, curd, and jaggery to offer the moon god before the &#8216;tulsi&#8217; plant. After this maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon. In many parts of Gujarat, Garba (a form of dance) takes place in the presence of moonlight. The Kojagari Purnima concerns the observance of the Kojagara Vrata. People perform this Vrata under the moonlight after fasting for the day. Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth, is significantly worshipped on this day as it is believed to be her birthday. Lord Indra, the God of Rains, along with his elephant Airavata is also worshipped. It is believed that on the night of Sharad Purnima, the raas (a form of dance) of Radha Krishna also takes place along with their gopis. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kolkata’s (Calcutta) is one of the finest and heritage Gallery called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExperimenterGallery/">Experimenter</a>. It was co-founded by Prateek &amp; Priyanka Raja in 2009, with a multidisciplinary approach, the gallery is an incubator for an ambitious and challenging contemporary practice. The program represents some of the most critical contemporary artists worldwide. </p>

<p>The program, rooted in dialogue and dissent, is considered to be a ‘pace-setter’ for its region, and extends from exhibition-making to knowledge creation, through regular talks, performances, workshops and through its much acclaimed, annual curatorial intensive – <a href="https://experimenter.in/">Experimenter</a> <a href="https://experimenter.in/curators-hub/">Curators’ Hub</a>. A second, more ambitious space was added in 2018, marking a deeper inquisition into the gallery’s realm of interest. The gallery attempts to expand the scope of contemporary practice beyond the ambit of its expected role. In 2016, its artist-book publishing wing was launched followed by the Experimenter Learning Program in 2018 which enables learning in fields of contemporary and performing arts, curatorship, film, writing, language and social culture. In 2019, Experimenter Outpost, an iterative exhibitions program outside the physical gallery temporarily inhabiting disused, characterful spaces were formed. 2020 marked the beginning of Experimenter Labs an inclusive, experimental and multi-dimensional online platform in addition to the onsite gallery programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/experimenterkol/">Experimenter</a> started with a love story. When Prateek Raja told childhood sweetheart Priyanka about his long-held ambition to open a cutting-edge art gallery, she did not hesitate for a second. The then-media manager quit her job, and packed her bags; the couple spent a year meeting artists and plotting their future venture. Experimenter opened in 2009. It has since then established itself as one of India’s leading galleries, boasting two spaces in the country’s cultural capital, Kolkata, and championing the likes of Prabhakar Pachpute, artist collective CAMP, and Naeem Mohaiemen.</p>

<p>On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh Visarjan takes place. The concluding day of the 10-day festival is also popularly known as Anant Chaturdashi. As the word &#8216;visarjan&#8217; implies, on this day immersion (&#8216;visarjan&#8217; means immersion) of Lord Ganapati&#8217;s idol takes place in a river, sea or water body. On the first day of the festival, the devotees mark the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi with the placement of Lord Ganesha&#8217;s idol in their homes, public places and offices. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God and perform immersion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In my childhood, I didn&#8217;t know about kashful stories or association with Durga Puja, so it was ignored, only I noticed a kashful nearby idol when it’s decked up and ready for Puja. During Autumn&#8217;s season when I used to go to school, the most preferred and best transport was cycling and walking. My School was situated beside the river. While I was travelling for school this Autumn Season and in other seasons also I saw White grass around the bank of the river and a corner of different portions. That time I didn&#8217;t feel about Kashful, maybe no one told me or I experienced such nostalgic and aesthetic pleasure of it. I can see every day lots of kashful around me but I never that label of interest to go closer and bring it to my home. </p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons was that time Internet was not available or a device to access it, yes I’m talking about that era, now when I look back that was a time when I spent the most time with nature and observing each and every movement. At that time I didn&#8217;t know about photography or filmmaking, I basically didn&#8217;t have access to cameras, most of my time was spent with nature and offline with friends and alone. When I look back I’m so happy, because of that I developed a different connection with nature and human beings around us. See here I want to know everything not just specific nature or human beings, most observations or would say priority first was nature then human, and others. Now I have learned, watched, listened to and connected lots of stories and linked with Durga puja. It gives me goosebumps. In a way, I experienced all of the things before knowing it, which gives me enough joy and want to explore or picturise it in my way.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kids Playing with Kashful in Village" class="wp-image-176" srcset="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Kids Playing with Kashful in Village.

<p>Now I know everything like Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali Trail line scene where apu and Durga, Rabindra Sangeet and others Pujor gaan, Autumn season, Ma Asche and many more. All of the things are now visualised with what I’m seeing, basically kashful photos or footage I saw everywhere along with a Durga idol or related to Durga puja. It’s very fascinating to me believe it or not I never touch kashful by hand, and always wanted that experience. To be very honest without education and knowledge I never given importance to kashful, most ignored that time like background dancer. Childhood ignorance or without proper knowledge, after knowing the fact I missed a lot and want to experience it all over again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That journey was very memorable when I’m into filmmaking, photography, design and many other creative fields, because of this I have friends who also want to document or explore Kashful in a different way. At that time one of the popular social media was Facebook, we saw lots of friends updating their profile with Kashful and travelling to the land of Kash. During the Autumn season in the year of 2016 (Durga Puja), we first time travelling <strong>Palla Road</strong> nearby Bardhaman for Kashful. What an experience and journey started. That time I don’t have DSLR Camera only have Apple iPad Air 2 Device.</p>

<p> I used my iPad as a Camera and clicked lots of photos and some videos. I snapped lots of photos reason was I don’t know or have too much information, I should document everything so that later on I can reconnect and understand better way. In that mindset I was not photographing, I was documenting without knowing it. That’s why clicked lots of photos, now I think if I added every photo it looks like a video, because a very short period of time I snapped more photos, afraid of, If I missed anything or if the photo was not clicked or different thoughts keep in mind, looks like burst mode I used manually. That’s the reason I have backed memories and reconnect or study my activities very well and share photos in my blog. That habit helped me fall in love with the documentation in the research field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most important things was that time I wanted to make a film about my journey and upload it to YouTube, At that time I don’t know about anything like VLOGS (not popular or people don’t know about it), travel Videos and so on. Even though vlogs were not popular in India and other countries as well, few people are actually doing it. We prefer that time blogging only. There was no plan that I want to make videos of kashful or film documentation, it was only planned was photographing, kashful that’s enough for excitement and closer looks and of course touch the kashful. </p>

<p>During the journey, lots of things happened and then started filming it, small things like inside train and basic shots. When we reached Palla Road we take Groupie for Facebook, for blog and documenting memories. Then the process started when can we see kashful we’re almost there. Looks like I can’t describe that process, I will add a Podcast episode in future here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tram’s of Kolkata are now almost dying heritage, that old tradition, colour and vintage look almost going away with time. In 2021 now 6 Tram routes are only Working Conditions operated by WBTC (West Bengal Transport Corporation). So you will see that logo and Blue colour dress and bus Ticket on Tram, There’s no special ticket for Kolkata&#8217;s tram anymore. ​​Kolkata’s tram is the only and oldest (1902) in India, Environmental friendly &amp; icon of Kolkata. Quite a number of Bollywood movies were shot in those trams (Kahani, Piku and many more), especially famous route 36 (Khidirpur-Esplanade)</p>

<p>CTC or Calcutta Tramways Company was operating the tram and making tram, Kolkata tram in Asia’s first tram line though. The glorious history of Calcutta Tramways Co. (CTC) is a living portrait of city life over nearly a century. It has witnessed a flawless creation, planned growth in the middle of World War I and II accompanying famines, communal riots, independence movement and nonetheless, maturation of Bengali culture. Political unrests like the Naxalite movement were absorbed by the tramways in the early 70s while it was nationalised in 1978. However, the current history of CTC is faded by negligence and apathy of the competent authority to such an extent that its existence is facing a challenge today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After an initial setback of horse-drawn and steam-powered tramcars, the whole CTC network was electrified between 1902-05 and its service area was expanded till around 1945. Though less known, Howrah – the twin city of Calcutta, also had its own tramways similar to CTC from 1907-08 that were connected to the CTC network once the iconic Howrah bridge was erected in 1942. A remarkable feature of CTC was that in the pre-independence era, its development was at par with European standards. CTC workers union was a strong organization that could aggressively negotiate with British administrators because CTC was the lifeline of city commuters before the introduction of Calcutta State Transport Corporation in 1948. In the post-independent era, 25 tramcars were built indigenously at the Nonapukur workshop in 1975. With assistance from the World Bank, the CTC service area was expanded and 200 new tramcars were added to the ailing fleet during the 1980s.</p>
