<ol start="3"><li>TOTE BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A large 2-handled open-topped bag (as of canvas). Famous for dangling from the arms of schlepping New Yorkers, tempting patrons at indie bookstores, or holding the groceries of eco-conscious fashionistas, tote bags have been a cultural phenomenon for generations. This versatile bag has evolved past its humble origins to become a signature look from Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and more.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Fashioning a sack out of cotton or leather materials is nothing new, humans have been doing it forever, but what we know as the tote bag&#8211;resplendent in its minimalism and radiant in its practicality—traces its origins back to the verb “to tote”. Popularized in the 17th century, the verb “tote” meant “to carry by hand” or, less gracefully put, “to lug.” While tote bags are traditionally made of canvas, there are no actual limitations to what a tote bag is made of. As long as it can be lugged around, it’s a tote bag!</p>



<ol start="4"><li>LUGGAGE BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For trips away, whether on a plane or via a car or train, when you need to carry more stuff with you, nothing beats rolling luggage. It’s too convenient not having to lug around your luggage on your back or by carrying it by the handles when this bag can be gliding effortlessly next to you.</p>



<ol start="5"><li>TOILETRY KIT or DOPP BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The final bag or piece of luggage you need is a Toiletry Kit or&nbsp; Dopp kit for all your toiletries and grooming essentials. These are great for trips or for any sort of travel. They keep your stuff organized, are sophisticated-looking and are just a joy to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata Metro or Heritage Metro of Kolkata is one of the proud moments of Kolkata(Calcutta) People. The Metro Railway, Calcutta on Sunday (24th October 2021) formally bade farewell to non-AC rakes, some of which have been in service since its inception as the country&#8217;s first underground railway in 1984. Which started services 37 years ago between Esplanade and Bhowanipore (at present Netaji Bhavan station), a distance of 3.40 km, now covers 31.3 km.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata &#8211; the city of joy, the cultural capital of India, and a city home to millions. The city that is packed with the impressions of colonial era blended with a touch of modern amenities, is also the third most populated urban area in India. As industries flourished, Calcutta got squeezed by its limited road space. With overflowing traffic all around, the city was starving with its lack of efficiency. That&#8217;s when the Metro Railway was conceptualized. Aiming to keep the city moving, we started building India&#8217;s First Ever Metro Rail!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">But the idea of a metro rail is not new! As can be seen in the pioneer, the metro railway in Calcutta was conceptualized much earlier in 1921. As the situation deteriorated, the idea was revived in 1969 with the help of the Metropolitan Transport Project under the Ministry of Railways. Long before the recent years of India&#8217;s metro revolution, Metro Railway was formed under the Ministry of Railways to provide world-class amenities to Kolkata. Although the aim was promising, construction of such a project was very challenging in India back then. With fund crunches and lack of technology, we faced a huge difficulty in constructing your North-South Metro. But with the help of our German, Hungarian and Russian friends, we started materializing the project to make it a reality. With no standards provides, it was never easy to build the metro on our own. It took some time extra, but we couldn&#8217;t hold our excitement as the North-South Metro gradually took its shape. With struggles and quenches, work was completed. With the help of BHEL and NGEF, we brought indigenously developed metro trains that were manufactured in Chennai by the ICF. Thus, with the blessings of the people, the Kolkata Metro was dedicated to the service of the nation on 24th October, 1984.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">37 years ago, when the first metro arrived at Esplanade and opened its automatic sliding doors, people were awestruck! In a time when India still had Steam Engines chugging around, people only heard of the London Underground but never imagined something similar. Therefore, we soon acquired the tag of &#8216;India&#8217;s First, Kolkata&#8217;s Pride&#8217;. Soon after, things became better! As we expanded from Tollygunge to Dumdum, our metro took the entire load of the city! Our indigenous technologies soon proved to be the best alternative to Trams, Buses, Taxis, and whatever that spoiled the streets of Calcutta. Non-airconditioned and too noisy, but as our trains cruised through the tunnels, people proudly lauded us for making their lives easier!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we started with only 4 coaches per rake, metro&#8217;s immense footfall forced us to upgrade to 8 cars. Carrying lakhs of people through the tunnels every single day, Metro Railway Kolkata soon became a national symbol of success! From Delhi to Bangalore, from Mumbai to Chennai, cities across India took inspiration from our success and desperately planned their own metro projects.</p>

</div><figcaption>Yoga Inside Metro. Film: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the government&#8217;s sanction, we gradually went extra-miles to connect the southern fringes of New Garia. So, our ageing fleet of Non-AC trains became insufficient. Finally, with the inauguration of metro services up to Kavi Subhash, two fully Air Conditioned Metro rakes were inducted into service on 7th October 2010. As we ran our metro with the ageing Non-AC fleet, our commuters kept on skipping the trains in search of an AC Metro. Finally, the day has come when you don&#8217;t have to wait for an AC Metro! Metro Railway Kolkata proudly announces that non ac metro services have been permanently discontinued. As we have enough AC metro rakes, it is time to bid a farewell to Non-AC metro. Noisy tunnels and humid commutes are gone forever! After today, their doors will never open; their lights will never glow; the fans will never noise! The tales of Non-AC Metros will be permanently transferred to the pages of history!</p>

Future is as glorious as the past! Commute anywhere in a matter of minutes with our modern facilities! In Future, we&#8217;re bringing India&#8217;s first underwater metro near Howrah Bridge, the largest underground metro station at the Airport and the deepest underground metro station at Howrah.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima (a full moon) in the month of Kartika. Like many Hindu festivals, Karwa Chauth is based on the lunisolar calendar which accounts for all astronomical positions, especially positions of the moon which is used as a marker to calculate important dates. The festival falls on the fourth day after the full moon, in the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Kartik. On Karwa Chauth, married women, especially in North India, observe fast from sunrise to moonrise for the safety and longevity of their husbands. The Karwa Chauth fast is traditionally celebrated in the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is celebrated as Atla Tadde in Andhra Pradesh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In a New Normal Way, in a remote village of Bihar, where I went today to document and meanwhile took some short clippings, which I compiled with one of my favourite karwa chauth songs for you all to take a look at the rituals women perform for their husbands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">This time of the year when we officially celebrate with firecrackers or crackers(Bazi). Happy to see that now most of the sound firecrackers are very less popular and people also avoid buying them, only celebrating with the lights. Kali Puja, Diwali, Dev Deepawali or any other name you call it; this festival boasts the making of lights, that can be crackers, electric lights or Diya and many more. This is the prime time of selling and manufacturing firecrackers or Bazi market increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Chamahati and Nungi(also Called Nangi) are famous for making firecrackers (Manufacturing hub) of West Bengal. They are making Green Firecrackers for over a decade, due to some restrictions and flood now production very less in terms of the previous year. Champahati’s Haral Village is the maker of crackers when Diwali or kali puja near they sell their crackers roadside temporary shops and also those who have permanent shops sell them also. Those crackers made in Champahati are very cheap but other crackers imported from are not so cheap because those are not produced here. If you want to buy some crackers or wholesale purpose visit Champahati Rail Staton, it’s nearby <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DKc6RCLADV5dZrVv7">Champahati Bazi Market</a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Nungi is a neighbourhood in the Maheshtala of the South 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Champahati is a census town and a gram panchayat within the jurisdiction of the Baruipur police station in the Baruipur community development block in the Baruipur subdivision of the South 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. They now make eco-friendly crackers that anyone can buy and easy to sell and top of it environmentally friendly. Slowly now the trend of Sky lantern or fanush flying followed by traditional Diya is more popular when comes to celebrating Diwali or Kali Puja in Kolkata.&nbsp;</p>

Every year on the day of Kali Puja Afternoon (around 2-3 pm) they started flying fanush or hot air balloons from their courtyard along with fanush enthusiasts, friends and family; fanush makers are also there for support and help to make it successful.

Different communities like Photographers, clubs, Residencies or Housing complex people now take it seriously and fanush flying or Sky lantern now trend in Kolkata. In Kolkata we called fanush (Manush Fanush) because it’s started or we know from Bholanath Dham <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajoydutt.kolkata">Ajoy</a> Dutt’s house, that’s why that name referred from since then.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most popular or would say famous in terms of business and involvement by people is Durga Puja Kolkata. This is by far one of the major annual festivals or king of the festival in terms of popularity, grandeur and showcase for international tourism in Kolkata(Calcutta). When this Durga Puja ends people became sad and count days for next year Durga Puja 2022. That time knocking door another puja called Kojagori Lakshmi Pooja or Laxmi Puja. Though this puja basically happened during homes of households almost every house and few Bonedi bari’s of Kolkata take it next label. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">But some pandal or Puja Committee hold this puja as well because it’s a few days after Durga puja, they do the puja in the same pandal where Durga idol was there. Even they bought idols at the same time when they bought the Durga idol and extra ordered for the Laxmi idol too. In the same pandal, they worshipped Laxmi Puja on a very small scale. This way they do two pujas back to back one is Durga Puja and another is Laxmi Puja (The day of Laxmi Puja Kolkata 20th Oct 2021).<strong> দুগ্গা দুগ্গা করে লক্ষ্মী এলো ঘরে</strong> (Dugga Dugga kore lakkhi Elo Ghore) be like. This Laxmi Puja Kolkata, Kojagori Lakshmi Puja or Lakhi puja whatever name you call it, it’s actually followed by a diverse community of Kolkata. Bengali family hold this Puja called or referred to as <strong>Kojagori Laxmi Puja</strong>. Other communities hold as Laxmi Puja. These Puja attractions are Alpona given by women (anyone), Preparing Bhog like <strong>Naru (Sweets made of Coconut)</strong>, Sinni, Murki, Chire and many other delicious food items. Lakshmi Pooja happens in the evening (Sharad Purnima) followed by Conch Sounds and reciting Lakshmi Pacnachli.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Sharad Purnima</strong> (also known as Kumara Purnima(କୁମାର ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣିମା ), Kojagiri Purnima, Navanna Purnima, or Kaumudi Purnima is a harvest festival celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu lunar month of Ashvin (September to October), marking the end of the monsoon season. On this auspicious day, many divine pairs like Radha Krishna, Shiva Parvati, and Lakshmi Narayan are worshipped along with the moon and are offered flowers and kheer (sweet dish made of rice and milk). Deities in temples are usually dressed in white colour signifying the brightness of the moon. Many people observe full day fasting on this day. This day is celebrated differently in different parts of the country. In Odisha, on this day unmarried women keep fast with the popular belief of getting their suitable groom(kumara). This festival starts with maidens welcoming the sun god just at sunrise with a coconut-leaf-made-vessel called &#8216;kula&#8217; filled with fried paddy containing 7 fruits like coconut, banana, cucumber, betel nut, sugar-cane, guava followed by &#8216;Aarti&#8217;. In the evening they break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy of the morning along with the fruits, curd, and jaggery to offer the moon god before the &#8216;tulsi&#8217; plant. After this maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon. In many parts of Gujarat, Garba (a form of dance) takes place in the presence of moonlight. The Kojagari Purnima concerns the observance of the Kojagara Vrata. People perform this Vrata under the moonlight after fasting for the day. Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth, is significantly worshipped on this day as it is believed to be her birthday. Lord Indra, the God of Rains, along with his elephant Airavata is also worshipped. It is believed that on the night of Sharad Purnima, the raas (a form of dance) of Radha Krishna also takes place along with their gopis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata’s (Calcutta) is one of the finest and heritage Gallery called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExperimenterGallery/">Experimenter</a>. It was co-founded by Prateek &amp; Priyanka Raja in 2009, with a multidisciplinary approach, the gallery is an incubator for an ambitious and challenging contemporary practice.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The program, rooted in dialogue and dissent, is considered to be a ‘pace-setter’ for its region, and extends from exhibition-making to knowledge creation, through regular talks, performances, workshops and through its much acclaimed, annual curatorial intensive – <a href="https://experimenter.in/">Experimenter</a> <a href="https://experimenter.in/curators-hub/">Curators’ Hub</a>. A second, more ambitious space was added in 2018, marking a deeper inquisition into the gallery’s realm of interest. The gallery attempts to expand the scope of contemporary practice beyond the ambit of its expected role. In 2016, its artist-book publishing wing was launched followed by the Experimenter Learning Program in 2018 which enables learning in fields of contemporary and performing arts, curatorship, film, writing, language and social culture. In 2019, Experimenter Outpost, an iterative exhibitions program outside the physical gallery temporarily inhabiting disused, characterful spaces were formed. 2020 marked the beginning of Experimenter Labs an inclusive, experimental and multi-dimensional online platform in addition to the onsite gallery programming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/experimenterkol/">Experimenter</a> started with a love story. When Prateek Raja told childhood sweetheart Priyanka about his long-held ambition to open a cutting-edge art gallery, she did not hesitate for a second. The then-media manager quit her job, and packed her bags; the couple spent a year meeting artists and plotting their future venture. Experimenter opened in 2009. It has since then established itself as one of India’s leading galleries, boasting two spaces in the country’s cultural capital, Kolkata, and championing the likes of Prabhakar Pachpute, artist collective CAMP, and Naeem Mohaiemen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">How Kolkata dominant Durga Puja likewise Ganesh Puja Lead by Mumbai (Bombay). Most popular and celebrated festival in Mumbai. Nowadays though Kolkata also try to catch the trend and bring idol from Mumbai itself (not ordering from Kumartuli). So this way slowly the number of Ganesh Puja increasing year by year. This Ganesh Puja Started on 10th September 2021.&nbsp;</p>

On the first day of the festival, the devotees mark the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi with the placement of Lord Ganesha&#8217;s idol in their homes, public places and offices. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God and perform immersion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">In my childhood, I didn&#8217;t know about kashful stories or association with Durga Puja, so it was ignored, only I noticed a kashful nearby idol when it’s decked up and ready for Puja. During Autumn&#8217;s season when I used to go to school, the most preferred and best transport was cycling and walking. My School was situated beside the river. While I was travelling for school this Autumn Season and in other seasons also I saw White grass around the bank of the river and a corner of different portions. That time I didn&#8217;t feel about Kashful, maybe no one told me or I experienced such nostalgic and aesthetic pleasure of it. I can see every day lots of kashful around me but I never that label of interest to go closer and bring it to my home. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja" class="wp-image-175" srcset="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the biggest reasons was that time Internet was not available or a device to access it, yes I’m talking about that era, now when I look back that was a time when I spent the most time with nature and observing each and every movement. At that time I didn&#8217;t know about photography or filmmaking, I basically didn&#8217;t have access to cameras, most of my time was spent with nature and offline with friends and alone. When I look back I’m so happy, because of that I developed a different connection with nature and human beings around us. See here I want to know everything not just specific nature or human beings, most observations or would say priority first was nature then human, and others. Now I have learned, watched, listened to and connected lots of stories and linked with Durga puja. It gives me goosebumps. In a way, I experienced all of the things before knowing it, which gives me enough joy and want to explore or picturise it in my way.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kids Playing with Kashful in Village" class="wp-image-176" srcset="https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.sukantapal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Kids Playing with Kashful in Village. Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now I know everything like Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali Trail line scene where apu and Durga, Rabindra Sangeet and others Pujor gaan, Autumn season, Ma Asche and many more. All of the things are now visualised with what I’m seeing, basically kashful photos or footage I saw everywhere along with a Durga idol or related to Durga puja. It’s very fascinating to me believe it or not I never touch kashful by hand, and always wanted that experience. To be very honest without education and knowledge I never given importance to kashful, most ignored that time like background dancer. Childhood ignorance or without proper knowledge, after knowing the fact I missed a lot and want to experience it all over again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">That journey was very memorable when I’m into filmmaking, photography, design and many other creative fields, because of this I have friends who also want to document or explore Kashful in a different way. At that time one of the popular social media was Facebook, we saw lots of friends updating their profile with Kashful and travelling to the land of Kash. During the Autumn season in the year of 2016 (Durga Puja), we first time travelling <strong>Palla Road</strong> nearby Bardhaman for Kashful. What an experience and journey started. That time I don’t have DSLR Camera only have Apple iPad Air 2 Device.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">I used my iPad as a Camera and clicked lots of photos and some videos. I snapped lots of photos reason was I don’t know or have too much information, I should document everything so that later on I can reconnect and understand better way. In that mindset I was not photographing, I was documenting without knowing it. That’s why clicked lots of photos, now I think if I added every photo it looks like a video, because a very short period of time I snapped more photos, afraid of, If I missed anything or if the photo was not clicked or different thoughts keep in mind, looks like burst mode I used manually. That’s the reason I have backed memories and reconnect or study my activities very well and share photos in my blog. That habit helped me fall in love with the documentation in the research field. </p>

</div><figcaption>Autumn Festival is Coming. Film: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most important things was that time I wanted to make a film about my journey and upload it to YouTube, At that time I don’t know about anything like VLOGS (not popular or people don’t know about it), travel Videos and so on. Even though vlogs were not popular in India and other countries as well, few people are actually doing it. We prefer that time blogging only. There was no plan that I want to make videos of kashful or film documentation, it was only planned was photographing, kashful that’s enough for excitement and closer looks and of course touch the kashful. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">During the journey, lots of things happened and then started filming it, small things like inside train and basic shots. When we reached Palla Road we take Groupie for Facebook, for blog and documenting memories. Then the process started when can we see kashful we’re almost there. Looks like I can’t describe that process, I will add a Podcast episode in future here.</p>
