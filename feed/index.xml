										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most popular festivals in West Bengal/Kolkata is Durga Puja, famous for its Celebration and Economical boast. In December 2021 &#8216;Durga Puja in Kolkata&#8217; was inscribed in UNESCO&#8217;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, so this Year Durga Puja 2022 first time celebrated after receiving UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage Tag, though this year&#8217;s celebration started before mahalaya but the vibe was not there at all. The aftermath of major annual festivals or king of the festival in terms of popularity, grandeur and showcase for international tourism in Kolkata(Calcutta) ends followed by next year&#8217;s Durga Puja 2023 Dates announced. After that begins Kojagori Lakshmi Pooja or Laxmi Puja (মা লক্ষ্মী or Laksmi) knocking next door. This puja basically happened in almost every household and a few Bonedi bari’s of Kolkata take it next label. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Some pandal or Barowari Puja Committee Clubs hold this puja as well because it’s a few days after the Durga puja, they do this puja in the same Dismantle pandal where the Durga idol was there. They bought idols at the same time as they bought the Durga idol (extra ordered for the Laxmi idol too. In the same pandal), they worshipped Laxmi Puja on a very small scale just for the sake of it. This way they do two pujas back to back one after another,<strong> দুগ্গা দুগ্গা করে লক্ষ্মী এলো ঘরে</strong> (Dugga Dugga kore lakkhi Elo Ghore) be like. Kojagori Lakshmi Puja or Lakhi puja whatever name you call it, this Kojagori Laxmi Puja is worshipped in Bengali Hindu homes and commercial establishments as the goddess of wealth. These Puja attractions are White Color Alpona given by women (or anyone), preparing Bhog like Kichuri, making sweets <strong>Naru (Sweets made of Coconut)</strong> Narkol Chire, Sinni, Murki and many other delicious food items. Lakshmi Pooja performs in the evening of <strong>Sharad Purnima (Full Moon Day)</strong> followed by Conch Sounds and reciting Lakshmi Pacnachli.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Sharad Purnima</strong> (also known as Kumara Purnima(କୁମାର ପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣିମା ), Kojagiri Purnima, Navanna Purnima, or Kaumudi Purnima is a harvest festival celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu lunar month of Ashvin (September to October), marking the end of the monsoon season. On this auspicious day, many divine pairs like Radha Krishna, Shiva Parvati, and Lakshmi Narayan are worshipped along with the moon and are offered flowers and kheer (sweet dish made of rice and milk). Deities in temples are usually dressed in white colour signifying the brightness of the moon. Many people observe full-day fasting on this day. This day is celebrated differently in different parts of the country. In Odisha, on this day unmarried women keep fast with the popular belief of getting their suitable groom(kumara). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">This festival starts with maidens welcoming the sun god just at sunrise with a coconut-leaf-made-vessel called &#8216;kula&#8217; filled with fried paddy containing 7 fruits like coconut, banana, cucumber, betel nut, sugar-cane, guava followed by &#8216;Aarti&#8217;. In the evening they break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy of the morning along with the fruits, curd, and jaggery to offer the moon god before the &#8216;tulsi&#8217; plant. After this maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon. In many parts of Gujarat, Garba (a form of dance) takes place in the presence of moonlight. The Kojagari Purnima concerns the observance of the Kojagara Vrata. People perform this Vrata under the moonlight after fasting for the day. Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth, is significantly worshipped on this day as it is believed to be her birthday. Lord Indra, the God of Rains, along with his elephant Airavata is also worshipped. It is believed that on the night of Sharad Purnima, the raas (a form of dance) of Radha Krishna also takes place along with their gopis.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laksmi Puja’22 by Aloke Kumar</h4>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Lakṣmī puja is the most neglected and taken for granted puja in the Hindu Almanac. Since she has just visited us accompanying her mother in the Sharadotsav and coming back on the fifth day after returning to Kailash, her position is somewhat eroded like the married daughter coming home too early. Though she is worshipped daily in Bengali Hindu homes and commercial establishments as the goddess of wealth, she is given a step motherly treatment in the Sarbojinin puja. Her puja in the pandals are a leftover of funds from the worship of her mother Durga and she is not given the pride of place to either create a new pandal or given the due which she deserves. Much of this neglect is subterfuged under the guise of muted decor and puja as Lakṣmī is believed to be in favour of ‘calm and quiet’. But that is just a lame excuse and she knows it too. She bears us no grudge In the traditional Bengali home she is worshiped on the day of Diwali when her alter image, the OLakṣmī is driven out and Lakṣmī is ushered in. It was left to the migrants of East Bengal to celebrate Lakṣmī puja on Kojagiri Purnima and hoist her in the exalted position. First, to worship her in the Lakṣmī &#8216;sara&#8217; and then moving to the idol. Having lost everything in the partition of 1947 and making the other part of Bengal their home, they continued their reverence, praying to give them prosperity. She did not disappoint them and showered them with her blessings. Seeing this their Western brethren followed suit. Lakṣmī is the Hindu Goddess of wealth, prosperity, both material and spiritual, fortune, and the embodiment of beauty. She is also worshipped as the consort of Vishnu. She is also known as Mahalakshmi, is said to bring good luck and is believed to protect her devotees from all kinds of misery and money-related sorrows. In Bengal, Lakṣmī is worshiped in autumn when the moon is full, the brightest night of the year. It is believed that she showers wealth on this night. She, along with her bahana, the great white owl, descends to earth and takes away the darkness of poverty, stagnation, anger, and laziness from our lives. Her bahana owl represents royalties, penetrating sight and intelligence. It serves as her mount over which she rides. Lakṣmī is also referred to as pranadayini,&#8221;giver of vital life-sustaining energy&#8221; who can turn a dull thing full of life. One of the most compelling stories in Hindu mythology is that of the Churning of the Milky Ocean. It is the story of the gods versus the demons and their fight to gain immortality. It also tells of the rebirth of Lakṣmī . Devas, gods, and asuras, demons, were both mortal at one time, in Hinduism. Amrit, the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning the Kshirsagar,the Ocean of Milk. The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirsagar. The samudra manthan commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. Vishnu incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise, and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. Vasuki, the great venom-spewing serpent, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakṣmī, the daughter of Bhrigu and Khyaati. The last to come up was the Amrita. The avatar of Kurma, the tortoise, ended with this. Vishnu then took up the form of a beautiful maiden to distract the asuras and gave immortality to the devas. She is &#8216;shakti-roopa&#8217; of &#8216;parabrahma&#8217; or &#8216;adi dev narayan&#8217; in the &#8216;Mahalakṣmī&#8217; story. OLakṣmī the goddess of misfortune, is Lakṣmī&#8217;s elder sister, her alter image. Lakṣmī is called Shree or Thirumagal because she is endowed with six auspicious and divine qualities, or Gunas, and also because she is the source of strength even to Vishnu. She is commonly portrayed as a beautiful woman, standing on a lotus flower. There is her ‘bahana’ the white owl which accompanies her.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="3"><li>TOTE BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A large 2-handled open-topped bag (as of canvas). Famous for dangling from the arms of schlepping New Yorkers, tempting patrons at indie bookstores, or holding the groceries of eco-conscious fashionistas, tote bags have been a cultural phenomenon for generations. This versatile bag has evolved past its humble origins to become a signature look from Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and more.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Fashioning a sack out of cotton or leather materials is nothing new, humans have been doing it forever, but what we know as the tote bag&#8211;resplendent in its minimalism and radiant in its practicality—traces its origins back to the verb “to tote”. Popularized in the 17th century, the verb “tote” meant “to carry by hand” or, less gracefully put, “to lug.” While tote bags are traditionally made of canvas, there are no actual limitations to what a tote bag is made of. As long as it can be lugged around, it’s a tote bag!</p>



<ol start="4"><li>LUGGAGE BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For trips away, whether on a plane or via a car or train, when you need to carry more stuff with you, nothing beats rolling luggage. It’s too convenient not having to lug around your luggage on your back or by carrying it by the handles when this bag can be gliding effortlessly next to you.</p>



<ol start="5"><li>TOILETRY KIT or DOPP BAG &#8211;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The final bag or piece of luggage you need is a Toiletry Kit or&nbsp; Dopp kit for all your toiletries and grooming essentials. These are great for trips or for any sort of travel. They keep your stuff organized, are sophisticated-looking and are just a joy to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata Metro or Heritage Metro of Kolkata is one of the proud moments of Kolkata(Calcutta) People.&nbsp;The Metro Railway, Calcutta on Sunday (24th October 2021) formally bade farewell to non-AC rakes, some of which have been in service since its inception as the country&#8217;s first underground railway in 1984. Which started services 37 years ago between Esplanade and Bhowanipore (at present Netaji Bhavan station), a distance of 3.40 km, now covers 31.3 km.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="769" height="1024" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg" alt="File Picture of Kolkata's Metro" class="wp-image-333" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg 769w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-768x1023.jpg 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-640x853.jpg 640w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-150x200.jpg 150w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">East-West Kolkata Metro Platform.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata &#8211; the city of joy, the cultural capital of India, and a city home to millions. The city that is packed with the impressions of colonial era blended with a touch of modern amenities, is also the third most populated urban area in India. As industries flourished, Calcutta got squeezed by its limited road space. With overflowing traffic all around, the city was starving with its lack of efficiency. That&#8217;s when the Metro Railway was conceptualized. Aiming to keep the city moving, we started building India&#8217;s First Ever Metro Rail!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">But the idea of a metro rail is not new! As can be seen in the pioneer, the metro railway in Calcutta was conceptualized much earlier in 1921. As the situation deteriorated, the idea was revived in 1969 with the help of the Metropolitan Transport Project under the Ministry of Railways. Long before the recent years of India&#8217;s metro revolution, Metro Railway was formed under the Ministry of Railways to provide world-class amenities to Kolkata. Although the aim was promising, construction of such a project was very challenging in India back then. With fund crunches and lack of technology, we faced a huge difficulty in constructing your North-South Metro. But with the help of our German, Hungarian and Russian friends, we started materializing the project to make it a reality. With no standards provides, it was never easy to build the metro on our own. It took some time extra, but we couldn&#8217;t hold our excitement as the North-South Metro gradually took its shape. With struggles and quenches, work was completed. With the help of BHEL and NGEF, we brought indigenously developed metro trains that were manufactured in Chennai by the ICF. Thus, with the blessings of the people, the Kolkata Metro was dedicated to the service of the nation on 24th October, 1984.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">37 years ago, when the first metro arrived at Esplanade and opened its automatic sliding doors, people were awestruck! In a time when India still had Steam Engines chugging around, people only heard of the London Underground but never imagined something similar. Therefore, we soon acquired the tag of &#8216;India&#8217;s First, Kolkata&#8217;s Pride&#8217;. Soon after, things became better! As we expanded from Tollygunge to Dumdum, our metro took the entire load of the city! Our indigenous technologies soon proved to be the best alternative to Trams, Buses, Taxis, and whatever that spoiled the streets of Calcutta. Non-airconditioned and too noisy, but as our trains cruised through the tunnels, people proudly lauded us for making their lives easier!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we started with only 4 coaches per rake, metro&#8217;s immense footfall forced us to upgrade to 8 cars. Carrying lakhs of people through the tunnels every single day, Metro Railway Kolkata soon became a national symbol of success! From Delhi to Bangalore, from Mumbai to Chennai, cities across India took inspiration from our success and desperately planned their own metro projects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the government&#8217;s sanction, we gradually went extra-miles to connect the southern fringes of New Garia. So, our ageing fleet of Non-AC trains became insufficient. Finally, with the inauguration of metro services up to Kavi Subhash, two fully Air Conditioned Metro rakes were inducted into service on 7th October 2010. As we ran our metro with the ageing Non-AC fleet, our commuters kept on skipping the trains in search of an AC Metro. Finally, the day has come when you don&#8217;t have to wait for an AC Metro! Metro Railway Kolkata proudly announces that non ac metro services have been permanently discontinued. As we have enough AC metro rakes, it is time to bid a farewell to Non-AC metro. Noisy tunnels and humid commutes are gone forever! After today, their doors will never open; their lights will never glow; the fans will never noise! The tales of Non-AC Metros will be permanently transferred to the pages of history!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Karwa Chauth (करवा चौथ) is one of the major festivals, celebrated widely throughout the country, in such pandemic situations at home, abiding all covid safety norms, in new normal way. Its said that while gods had a battle with Ashuras, the Goddess Parvati, Lakshmi, Saraswati and others kept fast for their husbands and wished for their victory over evil power. Since then women on this day fast and pray for their husband&#8217;s long life and safety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima (a full moon) in the month of Kartika. Like many Hindu festivals, Karwa Chauth is based on the lunisolar calendar which accounts for all astronomical positions, especially positions of the moon which is used as a marker to calculate important dates. The festival falls on the fourth day after the full moon, in the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Kartik. On Karwa Chauth, married women, especially in North India, observe fast from sunrise to moonrise for the safety and longevity of their husbands. The Karwa Chauth fast is traditionally celebrated in the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is celebrated as Atla Tadde in Andhra Pradesh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In a New Normal Way, in a remote village of Bihar, where I went today to document and meanwhile took some short clippings, which I compiled with one of my favourite karwa chauth songs for you all to take a look at the rituals women perform for their husbands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">This time of the year when we officially celebrate with firecrackers or crackers(Bazi). Happy to see that now most of the sound firecrackers are very less popular and people also avoid buying them, only celebrating with the lights. Kali Puja, Diwali, Dev Deepawali or any other name you call it; this festival boasts the making of lights, that can be crackers, electric lights or Diya and many more. This is the prime time of selling and manufacturing firecrackers or Bazi market increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Chamahati and Nungi(also Called Nangi) are famous for making firecrackers (Manufacturing hub) of West Bengal. They are making Green Firecrackers for over a decade, due to some restrictions and flood now production very less in terms of the previous year. Champahati’s Haral Village is the maker of crackers when Diwali or kali puja near they sell their crackers roadside temporary shops and also those who have permanent shops sell them also. Those crackers made in Champahati are very cheap but other crackers imported from are not so cheap because those are not produced here. If you want to buy some crackers or wholesale purpose visit Champahati Rail Staton, it’s nearby <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DKc6RCLADV5dZrVv7">Champahati Bazi Market</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata’s (Calcutta) is one of the finest and heritage Gallery called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ExperimenterGallery/">Experimenter</a>. It was co-founded by Prateek &amp; Priyanka Raja in 2009, with a multidisciplinary approach, the gallery is an incubator for an ambitious and challenging contemporary practice. The program represents some of the most critical contemporary artists worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The program, rooted in dialogue and dissent, is considered to be a ‘pace-setter’ for its region, and extends from exhibition-making to knowledge creation, through regular talks, performances, workshops and through its much acclaimed, annual curatorial intensive – <a href="https://experimenter.in/">Experimenter</a> <a href="https://experimenter.in/curators-hub/">Curators’ Hub</a>. A second, more ambitious space was added in 2018, marking a deeper inquisition into the gallery’s realm of interest. The gallery attempts to expand the scope of contemporary practice beyond the ambit of its expected role. In 2016, its artist-book publishing wing was launched followed by the Experimenter Learning Program in 2018 which enables learning in fields of contemporary and performing arts, curatorship, film, writing, language and social culture. In 2019, Experimenter Outpost, an iterative exhibitions program outside the physical gallery temporarily inhabiting disused, characterful spaces were formed. 2020 marked the beginning of Experimenter Labs an inclusive, experimental and multi-dimensional online platform in addition to the onsite gallery programming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/experimenterkol/">Experimenter</a> started with a love story. When Prateek Raja told childhood sweetheart Priyanka about his long-held ambition to open a cutting-edge art gallery, she did not hesitate for a second. The then-media manager quit her job, and packed her bags; the couple spent a year meeting artists and plotting their future venture. Experimenter opened in 2009. It has since then established itself as one of India’s leading galleries, boasting two spaces in the country’s cultural capital, Kolkata, and championing the likes of Prabhakar Pachpute, artist collective CAMP, and Naeem Mohaiemen.</p>

On the first day of the festival, the devotees mark the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi with the placement of Lord Ganesha&#8217;s idol in their homes, public places and offices. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God and perform immersion.</p>
