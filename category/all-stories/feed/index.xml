										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata Metro or Heritage Metro of Kolkata is one of the proud moments of Kolkata(Calcutta) People.&nbsp;The Metro Railway, Calcutta on Sunday (24th October 2021) formally bade farewell to non-AC rakes, some of which have been in service since its inception as the country&#8217;s first underground railway in 1984. Which started services 37 years ago between Esplanade and Bhowanipore (at present Netaji Bhavan station), a distance of 3.40 km, now covers 31.3 km.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="769" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg" alt="File Picture of Kolkata's Metro" class="wp-image-333" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg 769w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-225x300.jpg 225w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-768x1023.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-640x853.jpg 640w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-150x200.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/07/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform.jpg 1537w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">East-West Kolkata Metro Platform.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata &#8211; the city of joy, the cultural capital of India, and a city home to millions. The city that is packed with the impressions of colonial era blended with a touch of modern amenities, is also the third most populated urban area in India. As industries flourished, Calcutta got squeezed by its limited road space. With overflowing traffic all around, the city was starving with its lack of efficiency. That&#8217;s when the Metro Railway was conceptualized. Aiming to keep the city moving, we started building India&#8217;s First Ever Metro Rail!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">But the idea of a metro rail is not new! As can be seen in the pioneer, the metro railway in Calcutta was conceptualized much earlier in 1921. As the situation deteriorated, the idea was revived in 1969 with the help of the Metropolitan Transport Project under the Ministry of Railways. Long before the recent years of India&#8217;s metro revolution, Metro Railway was formed under the Ministry of Railways to provide world-class amenities to Kolkata. Although the aim was promising, construction of such a project was very challenging in India back then. With fund crunches and lack of technology, we faced a huge difficulty in constructing your North-South Metro. But with the help of our German, Hungarian and Russian friends, we started materializing the project to make it a reality. With no standards provides, it was never easy to build the metro on our own. It took some time extra, but we couldn&#8217;t hold our excitement as the North-South Metro gradually took its shape. With struggles and quenches, work was completed. With the help of BHEL and NGEF, we brought indigenously developed metro trains that were manufactured in Chennai by the ICF. Thus, with the blessings of the people, the Kolkata Metro was dedicated to the service of the nation on 24th October, 1984.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">37 years ago, when the first metro arrived at Esplanade and opened its automatic sliding doors, people were awestruck! In a time when India still had Steam Engines chugging around, people only heard of the London Underground but never imagined something similar. Therefore, we soon acquired the tag of &#8216;India&#8217;s First, Kolkata&#8217;s Pride&#8217;. Soon after, things became better! As we expanded from Tollygunge to Dumdum, our metro took the entire load of the city! Our indigenous technologies soon proved to be the best alternative to Trams, Buses, Taxis, and whatever that spoiled the streets of Calcutta. Non-airconditioned and too noisy, but as our trains cruised through the tunnels, people proudly lauded us for making their lives easier!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we started with only 4 coaches per rake, metro&#8217;s immense footfall forced us to upgrade to 8 cars. Carrying lakhs of people through the tunnels every single day, Metro Railway Kolkata soon became a national symbol of success! From Delhi to Bangalore, from Mumbai to Chennai, cities across India took inspiration from our success and desperately planned their own metro projects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the government&#8217;s sanction, we gradually went extra-miles to connect the southern fringes of New Garia. So, our ageing fleet of Non-AC trains became insufficient. Finally, with the inauguration of metro services up to Kavi Subhash, two fully Air Conditioned Metro rakes were inducted into service on 7th October 2010. As we ran our metro with the ageing Non-AC fleet, our commuters kept on skipping the trains in search of an AC Metro. Finally, the day has come when you don&#8217;t have to wait for an AC Metro! Metro Railway Kolkata proudly announces that non ac metro services have been permanently discontinued. As we have enough AC metro rakes, it is time to bid a farewell to Non-AC metro. Noisy tunnels and humid commutes are gone forever! After today, their doors will never open; their lights will never glow; the fans will never noise! The tales of Non-AC Metros will be permanently transferred to the pages of history!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Karwa Chauth (करवा चौथ) is one of the major festivals, celebrated widely throughout the country, in such pandemic situations at home, abiding all covid safety norms, in new normal way. Its said that while gods had a battle with Ashuras, the Goddess Parvati, Lakshmi, Saraswati and others kept fast for their husbands and wished for their victory over evil power. Since then women on this day fast and pray for their husband&#8217;s long life and safety.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal-1024x682.jpg" alt="Karva Chauth Celebrations in West Bengal" class="wp-image-223" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal-1024x682.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karva-Chauth-Celebrations-in-West-Bengal.jpg 1856w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Karva Chauth Celebrations in West Bengal.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima (a full moon) in the month of Kartika. Like many Hindu festivals, Karwa Chauth is based on the lunisolar calendar which accounts for all astronomical positions, especially positions of the moon which is used as a marker to calculate important dates. The festival falls on the fourth day after the full moon, in the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Kartik. On Karwa Chauth, married women, especially in North India, observe fast from sunrise to moonrise for the safety and longevity of their husbands. The Karwa Chauth fast is traditionally celebrated in the states of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It is celebrated as Atla Tadde in Andhra Pradesh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In a New Normal Way, in a remote village of Bihar, where I went today to document and meanwhile took some short clippings, which I compiled with one of my favourite karwa chauth songs for you all to take a look at the rituals women perform for their husbands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">This time of the year when we officially celebrate with firecrackers or crackers(Bazi). Happy to see that now most of the sound firecrackers are very less popular and people also avoid buying them, only celebrating with the lights. Kali Puja, Diwali, Dev Deepawali or any other name you call it; this festival boasts the making of lights, that can be crackers, electric lights or Diya and many more. This is the prime time of selling and manufacturing firecrackers or Bazi market increase.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="623" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali-1024x623.jpg" alt="A man making fire crackers ahead of Diwali" class="wp-image-216" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali-1024x623.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali-300x183.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali-768x467.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali-1536x935.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-man-making-fire-crackers-ahead-of-Diwali.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>A man making fire crackers ahead of Diwali.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Chamahati and Nungi(also Called Nangi) are famous for making firecrackers (Manufacturing hub) of West Bengal. They are making Green Firecrackers for over a decade, due to some restrictions and flood now production very less in terms of the previous year. Champahati’s Haral Village is the maker of crackers when Diwali or kali puja near they sell their crackers roadside temporary shops and also those who have permanent shops sell them also. Those crackers made in Champahati are very cheap but other crackers imported from are not so cheap because those are not produced here. If you want to buy some crackers or wholesale purpose visit Champahati Rail Staton, it’s nearby <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DKc6RCLADV5dZrVv7">Champahati Bazi Market</a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Nungi is a neighbourhood in the Maheshtala of the South 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Champahati is a census town and a gram panchayat within the jurisdiction of the Baruipur police station in the Baruipur community development block in the Baruipur subdivision of the South 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. They now make eco-friendly crackers that anyone can buy and easy to sell and top of it environmentally friendly. Slowly now the trend of Sky lantern or fanush flying followed by traditional Diya is more popular when comes to celebrating Diwali or Kali Puja in Kolkata.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">On this occasion of Kali Puja, a few bonedi houses (Bonedi Barir Kali Puja Kolkata or Fanush Bari) of Kolkata or heritage houses of Calcutta flying fanush or hot air balloon in Kolkata (Calcutta). The most popular house is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NgehXQcb589HBDhC8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://goo.gl/maps/NgehXQcb589HBDhC8">Bholanath Dham</a> Family (<em>33/2, Beadon Street, Kolkata – 700006</em>), after Durga Puja, they started making fanush at their home’s Thakurdalan, it takes time to make because those fanush are big in size also designed fanush lots of paper cutting involved, that’s why it’s very time consuming to make lots of patience and skill is required to make one good fanush or hot air balloon. Every year on the day of Kali Puja Afternoon (around 2-3 pm) they started flying fanush or hot air balloons from their courtyard along with fanush enthusiasts, friends and family; fanush makers are also there for support and help to make it successful. This spectacular fanush flying event was documented by photographers; day by day the number of photographers increase, it’s great to see that fanush flying becoming a trend in Kolkata.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Started with Fanush Flying event in Kolkata, now Sky lantern or Chinese Lantern are very much popular for eco-friendly and opportunity for great profile picture or Facebook DP, it’s looking good and happy exercise for all of them. Different communities like Photographers, clubs, Residencies or Housing complex people now take it seriously and fanush flying or Sky lantern now trend in Kolkata. In Kolkata we called fanush (Manush Fanush) because it’s started or we know from Bholanath Dham <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ajoydutt.kolkata">Ajoy</a> Dutt’s house, that’s why that name referred from since then.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh Visarjan takes place. The concluding day of the 10-day festival is also popularly known as Anant Chaturdashi. As the word &#8216;visarjan&#8217; implies, on this day immersion (&#8216;visarjan&#8217; means immersion) of Lord Ganapati&#8217;s idol takes place in a river, sea or water body. On the first day of the festival, the devotees mark the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi with the placement of Lord Ganesha&#8217;s idol in their homes, public places and offices. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of their beloved God and perform immersion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">In my childhood, I didn&#8217;t know about kashful stories or association with Durga Puja, so it was ignored, only I noticed a kashful nearby idol when it’s decked up and ready for Puja. During Autumn&#8217;s season when I used to go to school, the most preferred and best transport was cycling and walking. My School was situated beside the river. While I was travelling for school this Autumn Season and in other seasons also I saw White grass around the bank of the river and a corner of different portions. That time I didn&#8217;t feel about Kashful, maybe no one told me or I experienced such nostalgic and aesthetic pleasure of it. I can see every day lots of kashful around me but I never that label of interest to go closer and bring it to my home. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja" class="wp-image-175" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928-768x576.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_7928.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the biggest reasons was that time Internet was not available or a device to access it, yes I’m talking about that era, now when I look back that was a time when I spent the most time with nature and observing each and every movement. At that time I didn&#8217;t know about photography or filmmaking, I basically didn&#8217;t have access to cameras, most of my time was spent with nature and offline with friends and alone. When I look back I’m so happy, because of that I developed a different connection with nature and human beings around us. See here I want to know everything not just specific nature or human beings, most observations or would say priority first was nature then human, and others. Now I have learned, watched, listened to and connected lots of stories and linked with Durga puja. It gives me goosebumps. In a way, I experienced all of the things before knowing it, which gives me enough joy and want to explore or picturise it in my way.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg" alt="Kids Playing with Kashful in Village" class="wp-image-176" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377-768x576.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8377.jpg 1264w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Kids Playing with Kashful in Village. Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now I know everything like Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali Trail line scene where apu and Durga, Rabindra Sangeet and others Pujor gaan, Autumn season, Ma Asche and many more. All of the things are now visualised with what I’m seeing, basically kashful photos or footage I saw everywhere along with a Durga idol or related to Durga puja. It’s very fascinating to me believe it or not I never touch kashful by hand, and always wanted that experience. To be very honest without education and knowledge I never given importance to kashful, most ignored that time like background dancer. Childhood ignorance or without proper knowledge, after knowing the fact I missed a lot and want to experience it all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6260-1024x768.jpg" alt="Talking Groupie" class="wp-image-174" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6260-1024x768.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6260-300x225.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6260-768x576.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_6260.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Sukanta Pal, Suchetana, Archita, Sanhedeep, Puspal and Anwesha at Palla road Burdwan(From Left to Right).Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">That journey was very memorable when I’m into filmmaking, photography, design and many other creative fields, because of this I have friends who also want to document or explore Kashful in a different way. At that time one of the popular social media was Facebook, we saw lots of friends updating their profile with Kashful and travelling to the land of Kash. During the Autumn season in the year of 2016 (Durga Puja), we first time travelling <strong>Palla Road</strong> nearby Bardhaman for Kashful. What an experience and journey started. That time I don’t have DSLR Camera only have Apple iPad Air 2 Device.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="678" height="1024" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049-678x1024.jpg" alt="Sukanta Pal Posing for Kashful DP" class="wp-image-173" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049-678x1024.jpg 678w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049-199x300.jpg 199w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049-768x1160.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049-1017x1536.jpg 1017w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC_1049.jpg 1277w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /><figcaption>Sukanta Pal Posing for Kashful DP. Photograph: Puspal Chandra | sukantapal.com</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I used my iPad as a Camera and clicked lots of photos and some videos. I snapped lots of photos reason was I don’t know or have too much information, I should document everything so that later on I can reconnect and understand better way. In that mindset I was not photographing, I was documenting without knowing it. That’s why clicked lots of photos, now I think if I added every photo it looks like a video, because a very short period of time I snapped more photos, afraid of, If I missed anything or if the photo was not clicked or different thoughts keep in mind, looks like burst mode I used manually. That’s the reason I have backed memories and reconnect or study my activities very well and share photos in my blog. That habit helped me fall in love with the documentation in the research field. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most important things was that time I wanted to make a film about my journey and upload it to YouTube, At that time I don’t know about anything like VLOGS (not popular or people don’t know about it), travel Videos and so on. Even though vlogs were not popular in India and other countries as well, few people are actually doing it. We prefer that time blogging only. There was no plan that I want to make videos of kashful or film documentation, it was only planned was photographing, kashful that’s enough for excitement and closer looks and of course touch the kashful. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">During the journey, lots of things happened and then started filming it, small things like inside train and basic shots. When we reached Palla Road we take Groupie for Facebook, for blog and documenting memories. Then the process started when can we see kashful we’re almost there. Looks like I can’t describe that process, I will add a Podcast episode in future here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Tram’s of Kolkata are now almost dying heritage, that old tradition, colour and vintage look almost going away with time. In 2021 now 6 Tram routes are only Working Conditions operated by WBTC (West Bengal Transport Corporation). So you will see that logo and Blue colour dress and bus Ticket on Tram, There’s no special ticket for Kolkata&#8217;s tram anymore. ​​Kolkata’s tram is the only and oldest (1902) in India, Environmental friendly &amp; icon of Kolkata. Quite a number of Bollywood movies were shot in those trams (Kahani, Piku and many more), especially famous route 36 (Khidirpur-Esplanade)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">CTC or Calcutta Tramways Company was operating the tram and making tram, Kolkata tram in Asia’s first tram line though. The glorious history of Calcutta Tramways Co. (CTC) is a living portrait of city life over nearly a century. It has witnessed a flawless creation, planned growth in the middle of World War I and II accompanying famines, communal riots, independence movement and nonetheless, maturation of Bengali culture. Political unrests like the Naxalite movement were absorbed by the tramways in the early 70s while it was nationalised in 1978. However, the current history of CTC is faded by negligence and apathy of the competent authority to such an extent that its existence is facing a challenge today.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After an initial setback of horse-drawn and steam-powered tramcars, the whole CTC network was electrified between 1902-05 and its service area was expanded till around 1945. Though less known, Howrah – the twin city of Calcutta, also had its own tramways similar to CTC from 1907-08 that were connected to the CTC network once the iconic Howrah bridge was erected in 1942. A remarkable feature of CTC was that in the pre-independence era, its development was at par with European standards. CTC workers union was a strong organization that could aggressively negotiate with British administrators because CTC was the lifeline of city commuters before the introduction of Calcutta State Transport Corporation in 1948. In the post-independent era, 25 tramcars were built indigenously at the Nonapukur workshop in 1975. With assistance from the World Bank, the CTC service area was expanded and 200 new tramcars were added to the ailing fleet during the 1980s.</p>
