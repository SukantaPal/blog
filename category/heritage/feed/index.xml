										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata Metro or Heritage Metro of Kolkata is one of the proud moments of Kolkata(Calcutta) People.Â The Metro Railway, Calcutta on Sunday (24th October 2021) formally bade farewell to non-AC rakes, some of which have been in service since its inception as the country&#8217;s first underground railway in 1984. Which started services 37 years ago between Esplanade and Bhowanipore (at present Netaji Bhavan station), a distance of 3.40 km, now covers 31.3 km.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Kolkata &#8211; the city of joy, the cultural capital of India, and a city home to millions. The city that is packed with the impressions of colonial era blended with a touch of modern amenities, is also the third most populated urban area in India. As industries flourished, Calcutta got squeezed by its limited road space. With overflowing traffic all around, the city was starving with its lack of efficiency. That&#8217;s when the Metro Railway was conceptualized. Aiming to keep the city moving, we started building India&#8217;s First Ever Metro Rail!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">But the idea of a metro rail is not new! As can be seen in the pioneer, the metro railway in Calcutta was conceptualized much earlier in 1921. As the situation deteriorated, the idea was revived in 1969 with the help of the Metropolitan Transport Project under the Ministry of Railways. Long before the recent years of India&#8217;s metro revolution, Metro Railway was formed under the Ministry of Railways to provide world-class amenities to Kolkata. Although the aim was promising, construction of such a project was very challenging in India back then. With fund crunches and lack of technology, we faced a huge difficulty in constructing your North-South Metro. But with the help of our German, Hungarian and Russian friends, we started materializing the project to make it a reality. With no standards provides, it was never easy to build the metro on our own. It took some time extra, but we couldn&#8217;t hold our excitement as the North-South Metro gradually took its shape. With struggles and quenches, work was completed. With the help of BHEL and NGEF, we brought indigenously developed metro trains that were manufactured in Chennai by the ICF. Thus, with the blessings of the people, the Kolkata Metro was dedicated to the service of the nation on 24th October, 1984.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">37 years ago, when the first metro arrived at Esplanade and opened its automatic sliding doors, people were awestruck! In a time when India still had Steam Engines chugging around, people only heard of the London Underground but never imagined something similar. Therefore, we soon acquired the tag of &#8216;India&#8217;s First, Kolkata&#8217;s Pride&#8217;. Soon after, things became better! As we expanded from Tollygunge to Dumdum, our metro took the entire load of the city! Our indigenous technologies soon proved to be the best alternative to Trams, Buses, Taxis, and whatever that spoiled the streets of Calcutta. Non-airconditioned and too noisy, but as our trains cruised through the tunnels, people proudly lauded us for making their lives easier!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we started with only 4 coaches per rake, metro&#8217;s immense footfall forced us to upgrade to 8 cars. Carrying lakhs of people through the tunnels every single day, Metro Railway Kolkata soon became a national symbol of success! From Delhi to Bangalore, from Mumbai to Chennai, cities across India took inspiration from our success and desperately planned their own metro projects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">With the government&#8217;s sanction, we gradually went extra-miles to connect the southern fringes of New Garia. So, our ageing fleet of Non-AC trains became insufficient. Finally, with the inauguration of metro services up to Kavi Subhash, two fully Air Conditioned Metro rakes were inducted into service on 7th October 2010. As we ran our metro with the ageing Non-AC fleet, our commuters kept on skipping the trains in search of an AC Metro. Finally, the day has come when you don&#8217;t have to wait for an AC Metro! Metro Railway Kolkata proudly announces that non ac metro services have been permanently discontinued. As we have enough AC metro rakes, it is time to bid a farewell to Non-AC metro. Noisy tunnels and humid commutes are gone forever! After today, their doors will never open; their lights will never glow; the fans will never noise! The tales of Non-AC Metros will be permanently transferred to the pages of history!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we expand our services to New Town in the East, Howrah Maidan in the west, Airport in the north and Joka in the extreme south, we pledge to provide cool and comfortable services to a station near you! Future is as glorious as the past! Commute anywhere in a matter of minutes with our modern facilities! In Future, we&#8217;re bringing India&#8217;s first underwater metro near Howrah Bridge, the largest underground metro station at the Airport and the deepest underground metro station at Howrah. Joining Sealdah with Howrah, Kalighat with Dakshineswar, Eco Park with Victoria and Barasat with Joka, your futuristic metro will revolutionize Kolkata&#8217;s Transport System!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">Tramâs of Kolkata are now almost dying heritage, that old tradition, colour and vintage look almost going away with time. In 2021 now 6 Tram routes are only Working Conditions operated by WBTC (West Bengal Transport Corporation). So you will see that logo and Blue colour dress and bus Ticket on Tram, Thereâs no special ticket for Kolkata&#8217;s tram anymore. ââKolkataâs tram is the only and oldest (1902) in India, Environmental friendly &amp; icon of Kolkata. Quite a number of Bollywood movies were shot in those trams (Kahani, Piku and many more), especially famous route 36 (Khidirpur-Esplanade)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">CTC or Calcutta Tramways Company was operating the tram and making tram, Kolkata tram in Asiaâs first tram line though. The glorious history of Calcutta Tramways Co. (CTC) is a living portrait of city life over nearly a century. It has witnessed a flawless creation, planned growth in the middle of World War I and II accompanying famines, communal riots, independence movement and nonetheless, maturation of Bengali culture. Political unrests like the Naxalite movement were absorbed by the tramways in the early 70s while it was nationalised in 1978. However, the current history of CTC is faded by negligence and apathy of the competent authority to such an extent that its existence is facing a challenge today.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">After an initial setback of horse-drawn and steam-powered tramcars, the whole CTC network was electrified between 1902-05 and its service area was expanded till around 1945. Though less known, Howrah â the twin city of Calcutta, also had its own tramways similar to CTC from 1907-08 that were connected to the CTC network once the iconic Howrah bridge was erected in 1942. A remarkable feature of CTC was that in the pre-independence era, its development was at par with European standards. CTC workers union was a strong organization that could aggressively negotiate with British administrators because CTC was the lifeline of city commuters before the introduction of Calcutta State Transport Corporation in 1948. In the post-independent era, 25 tramcars were built indigenously at the Nonapukur workshop in 1975. With assistance from the World Bank, the CTC service area was expanded and 200 new tramcars were added to the ailing fleet during the 1980s.</p>
