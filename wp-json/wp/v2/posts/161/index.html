The glorious history of Calcutta Tramways Co. (CTC) is a living portrait of city life over nearly a century. It has witnessed a flawless creation, planned growth in the middle of World War I and II accompanying famines, communal riots, independence movement and nonetheless, maturation of Bengali culture. Political unrests like the Naxalite movement were absorbed by the tramways in the early 70s while it was nationalised in 1978. However, the current history of CTC is faded by negligence and apathy of the competent authority to such an extent that its existence is facing a challenge today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">After an initial setback of horse-drawn and steam-powered tramcars, the whole CTC network was electrified between 1902-05 and its service area was expanded till around 1945. Though less known, Howrah \u2013 the twin city of Calcutta, also had its own tramways similar to CTC from 1907-08 that were connected to the CTC network once the iconic Howrah bridge was erected in 1942. A remarkable feature of CTC was that in the pre-independence era, its development was at par with European standards. CTC workers union was a strong organization that could aggressively negotiate with British administrators because CTC was the lifeline of city commuters before the introduction of Calcutta State Transport Corporation in 1948. In the post-independent era, 25 tramcars were built indigenously at the Nonapukur workshop in 1975. With assistance from the World Bank, the CTC service area was expanded and 200 new tramcars were added to the ailing fleet during the 1980s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Sukanta Pal inside AC tram of kolkata \" class=\"wp-image-163\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata-1536x864.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Sukanta-Pal-Ride-AC-Tram-of-Kolkata.jpg 1840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Sukanta Pal inside AC tram of Kolkata at Shyambazar Tram Depot.
