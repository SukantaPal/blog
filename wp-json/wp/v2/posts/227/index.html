Which started services 37 years ago between Esplanade and Bhowanipore (at present Netaji Bhavan station), a distance of 3.40 km, now covers 31.3 km.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg\" alt=\"File Picture of Kolkata's Metro\" class=\"wp-image-333\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-769x1024.jpg 769w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-768x1023.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-640x853.jpg 640w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform-150x200.jpg 150w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/East-West-Kolkata-Metro-Platform.jpg 1537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" \/><figcaption>East-West Kolkata Metro Platform. Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Kolkata &#8211; the city of joy, the cultural capital of India, and a city home to millions. The city that is packed with the impressions of colonial era blended with a touch of modern amenities, is also the third most populated urban area in India. As industries flourished, Calcutta got squeezed by its limited road space. With overflowing traffic all around, the city was starving with its lack of efficiency. That&#8217;s when the Metro Railway was conceptualized. Aiming to keep the city moving, we started building India&#8217;s First Ever Metro Rail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">But the idea of a metro rail is not new! As can be seen in the pioneer, the metro railway in Calcutta was conceptualized much earlier in 1921. As the situation deteriorated, the idea was revived in 1969 with the help of the Metropolitan Transport Project under the Ministry of Railways. Long before the recent years of India&#8217;s metro revolution, Metro Railway was formed under the Ministry of Railways to provide world-class amenities to Kolkata. Although the aim was promising, construction of such a project was very challenging in India back then. With fund crunches and lack of technology, we faced a huge difficulty in constructing your North-South Metro. But with the help of our German, Hungarian and Russian friends, we started materializing the project to make it a reality. With no standards provides, it was never easy to build the metro on our own. It took some time extra, but we couldn&#8217;t hold our excitement as the North-South Metro gradually took its shape. With struggles and quenches, work was completed. With the help of BHEL and NGEF, we brought indigenously developed metro trains that were manufactured in Chennai by the ICF. Thus, with the blessings of the people, the Kolkata Metro was dedicated to the service of the nation on 24th October, 1984.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Bengali YouTubers in Kolkata NEWEST METRO\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/42QN40etmrk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Metro travel. Film: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">37 years ago, when the first metro arrived at Esplanade and opened its automatic sliding doors, people were awestruck! In a time when India still had Steam Engines chugging around, people only heard of the London Underground but never imagined something similar. Therefore, we soon acquired the tag of &#8216;India&#8217;s First, Kolkata&#8217;s Pride&#8217;. Soon after, things became better! As we expanded from Tollygunge to Dumdum, our metro took the entire load of the city! Our indigenous technologies soon proved to be the best alternative to Trams, Buses, Taxis, and whatever that spoiled the streets of Calcutta. Non-airconditioned and too noisy, but as our trains cruised through the tunnels, people proudly lauded us for making their lives easier!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FINALLY Check in Kolkata East West Metro\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5SsShfuTomw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>&nbsp;First Time Vlogging Inside Metro.

Carrying lakhs of people through the tunnels every single day, Metro Railway Kolkata soon became a national symbol of success! From Delhi to Bangalore, from Mumbai to Chennai, cities across India took inspiration from our success and desperately planned their own metro projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"INSIDE of Kolkata East West Metro Station\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kM80X9BJvwc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Yoga Inside Metro.

So, our ageing fleet of Non-AC trains became insufficient. Finally, with the inauguration of metro services up to Kavi Subhash, two fully Air Conditioned Metro rakes were inducted into service on 7th October 2010. As we ran our metro with the ageing Non-AC fleet, our commuters kept on skipping the trains in search of an AC Metro. Finally, the day has come when you don&#8217;t have to wait for an AC Metro! Metro Railway Kolkata proudly announces that non ac metro services have been permanently discontinued. As we have enough AC metro rakes, it is time to bid a farewell to Non-AC metro. Noisy tunnels and humid commutes are gone forever! After today, their doors will never open; their lights will never glow; the fans will never noise! The tales of Non-AC Metros will be permanently transferred to the pages of history!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"LOCKED in East West Metro Corridor of Kolkata\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IjaxfSbuKLA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>&nbsp;Kolkata Metro Experience.
