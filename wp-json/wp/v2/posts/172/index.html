During Autumn&#8217;s season when I used to go to school, the most preferred and best transport was cycling and walking. My School was situated beside the river. While I was travelling for school this Autumn Season and in other seasons also I saw White grass around the bank of the river and a corner of different portions. That time I didn&#8217;t feel about Kashful, maybe no one told me or I experienced such nostalgic and aesthetic pleasure of it. I can see every day lots of kashful around me but I never that label of interest to go closer and bring it to my home. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja\" class=\"wp-image-175\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_7928-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_7928-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_7928-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_7928.jpg 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Kids Collecting Kashful for Durga Puja. Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">One of the biggest reasons was that time Internet was not available or a device to access it, yes I\u2019m talking about that era, now when I look back that was a time when I spent the most time with nature and observing each and every movement. At that time I didn&#8217;t know about photography or filmmaking, I basically didn&#8217;t have access to cameras, most of my time was spent with nature and offline with friends and alone. When I look back I\u2019m so happy, because of that I developed a different connection with nature and human beings around us. See here I want to know everything not just specific nature or human beings, most observations or would say priority first was nature then human, and others. Now I have learned, watched, listened to and connected lots of stories and linked with Durga puja. It gives me goosebumps. In a way, I experienced all of the things before knowing it, which gives me enough joy and want to explore or picturise it in my way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Kids Playing with Kashful in Village\" class=\"wp-image-176\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_8377-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_8377-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_8377-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_8377.jpg 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Kids Playing with Kashful in Village. Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Now I know everything like Satyajit Ray\u2019s film Pather Panchali Trail line scene where apu and Durga, Rabindra Sangeet and others Pujor gaan, Autumn season, Ma Asche and many more. All of the things are now visualised with what I\u2019m seeing, basically kashful photos or footage I saw everywhere along with a Durga idol or related to Durga puja. It\u2019s very fascinating to me believe it or not I never touch kashful by hand, and always wanted that experience. To be very honest without education and knowledge I never given importance to kashful, most ignored that time like background dancer. Childhood ignorance or without proper knowledge, after knowing the fact I missed a lot and want to experience it all over again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Talking Groupie\" class=\"wp-image-174\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Sukanta Pal, Suchetana, Archita, Sanhedeep, Puspal and Anwesha at Palla road Burdwan(From Left to Right).Photograph: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">That journey was very memorable when I\u2019m into filmmaking, photography, design and many other creative fields, because of this I have friends who also want to document or explore Kashful in a different way. At that time one of the popular social media was Facebook, we saw lots of friends updating their profile with Kashful and travelling to the land of Kash. During the Autumn season in the year of 2016 (Durga Puja), we first time travelling <strong>Palla Road<\/strong> nearby Bardhaman for Kashful. What an experience and journey started. That time I don\u2019t have DSLR Camera only have Apple iPad Air 2 Device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"678\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049-678x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Sukanta Pal Posing for Kashful DP\" class=\"wp-image-173\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049-678x1024.jpg 678w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049-199x300.jpg 199w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049-768x1160.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049-1017x1536.jpg 1017w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/DSC_1049.jpg 1277w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" \/><figcaption>Sukanta Pal Posing for Kashful DP. Photograph: Puspal Chandra | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I used my iPad as a Camera and clicked lots of photos and some videos. I snapped lots of photos reason was I don\u2019t know or have too much information, I should document everything so that later on I can reconnect and understand better way. In that mindset I was not photographing, I was documenting without knowing it. That\u2019s why clicked lots of photos, now I think if I added every photo it looks like a video, because a very short period of time I snapped more photos, afraid of, If I missed anything or if the photo was not clicked or different thoughts keep in mind, looks like burst mode I used manually. That\u2019s the reason I have backed memories and reconnect or study my activities very well and share photos in my blog. That habit helped me fall in love with the documentation in the research field.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Saroter KASHFUL - Autumn Festival\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ihmtJvx6EHE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Autumn Festival is Coming. Film: Sukanta Pal | sukantapal.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">One of the most important things was that time I wanted to make a film about my journey and upload it to YouTube, At that time I don\u2019t know about anything like VLOGS (not popular or people don\u2019t know about it), travel Videos and so on. Even though vlogs were not popular in India and other countries as well, few people are actually doing it. We prefer that time blogging only. There was no plan that I want to make videos of kashful or film documentation, it was only planned was photographing, kashful that\u2019s enough for excitement and closer looks and of course touch the kashful. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Palla Road - Land of Kashful\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LEGKucgScZE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>The first VLOG Documenting with my Apple iPad Air 2.

When we reached Palla Road we take Groupie for Facebook, for blog and documenting memories. Then the process started when can we see kashful we\u2019re almost there. Looks like I can\u2019t describe that process, I will add a Podcast episode in future here.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my childhood, I didn&#8217;t know about kashful stories or&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":174,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":4,"_editorskit_typography_data":[],"_editorskit_blocks_typography":"","_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","_kad_post_transparent":"","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false},"categories":[9],"tags":[10],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/IMG_6260.jpg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/172"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=172"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/172\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":248,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/172\/revisions\/248"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/174"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=172"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=172"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=172"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
