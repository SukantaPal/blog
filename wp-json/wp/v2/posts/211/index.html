In December 2021 &#8216;Durga Puja in Kolkata&#8217; was inscribed in UNESCO&#8217;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, so this Year Durga Puja 2022 first time celebrated after receiving UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage Tag, though this year&#8217;s celebration started before mahalaya but the vibe was not there at all. The aftermath of major annual festivals or king of the festival in terms of popularity, grandeur and showcase for international tourism in Kolkata(Calcutta) ends followed by next year&#8217;s Durga Puja 2023 Dates announced. After that begins Kojagori Lakshmi Pooja or Laxmi Puja (\u09ae\u09be \u09b2\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cd\u09ae\u09c0 or Laksmi) knocking next door.

They bought idols at the same time as they bought the Durga idol (extra ordered for the Laxmi idol too. In the same pandal), they worshipped Laxmi Puja on a very small scale just for the sake of it.

Deities in temples are usually dressed in white colour signifying the brightness of the moon. Many people observe full-day fasting on this day.

In the evening they break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy of the morning along with the fruits, curd, and jaggery to offer the moon god before the &#8216;tulsi&#8217; plant. After this maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon. In many parts of Gujarat, Garba (a form of dance) takes place in the presence of moonlight. The Kojagari Purnima concerns the observance of the Kojagara Vrata. People perform this Vrata under the moonlight after fasting for the day. Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth, is significantly worshipped on this day as it is believed to be her birthday. Lord Indra, the God of Rains, along with his elephant Airavata is also worshipped. It is believed that on the night of Sharad Purnima, the raas (a form of dance) of Radha Krishna also takes place along with their gopis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Kumartuli artisans making Laxmi Pot or Laxmi Sora after Durga Puja in Kolkata\" class=\"wp-image-212\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Kumartuli artisans making Laxmi Pot or Laxmi Sora after Durga Puja in Kolkata.

Since she has just visited us accompanying her mother in the Sharadotsav and coming back on the fifth day after returning to Kailash, her position is somewhat eroded like the married daughter coming home too early. Though she is worshipped daily in Bengali Hindu homes and commercial establishments as the goddess of wealth, she is given a step motherly treatment in the Sarbojinin puja. Her puja in the pandals are a leftover of funds from the worship of her mother Durga and she is not given the pride of place to either create a new pandal or given the due which she deserves. Much of this neglect is subterfuged under the guise of muted decor and puja as Lak\u1e63m\u012b is believed to be in favour of \u2018calm and quiet\u2019. But that is just a lame excuse and she knows it too. She bears us no grudge In the traditional Bengali home she is worshiped on the day of Diwali when her alter image, the OLak\u1e63m\u012b is driven out and Lak\u1e63m\u012b is ushered in. It was left to the migrants of East Bengal to celebrate Lak\u1e63m\u012b puja on Kojagiri Purnima and hoist her in the exalted position. First, to worship her in the Lak\u1e63m\u012b &#8216;sara&#8217; and then moving to the idol. Having lost everything in the partition of 1947 and making the other part of Bengal their home, they continued their reverence, praying to give them prosperity. She did not disappoint them and showered them with her blessings. Seeing this their Western brethren followed suit. Lak\u1e63m\u012b is the Hindu Goddess of wealth, prosperity, both material and spiritual, fortune, and the embodiment of beauty. She is also worshipped as the consort of Vishnu. She is also known as Mahalakshmi, is said to bring good luck and is believed to protect her devotees from all kinds of misery and money-related sorrows. In Bengal, Lak\u1e63m\u012b is worshiped in autumn when the moon is full, the brightest night of the year. It is believed that she showers wealth on this night. She, along with her bahana, the great white owl, descends to earth and takes away the darkness of poverty, stagnation, anger, and laziness from our lives. Her bahana owl represents royalties, penetrating sight and intelligence. It serves as her mount over which she rides. Lak\u1e63m\u012b is also referred to as pranadayini,&#8221;giver of vital life-sustaining energy&#8221; who can turn a dull thing full of life. One of the most compelling stories in Hindu mythology is that of the Churning of the Milky Ocean. It is the story of the gods versus the demons and their fight to gain immortality. It also tells of the rebirth of Lak\u1e63m\u012b . Devas, gods, and asuras, demons, were both mortal at one time, in Hinduism. Amrit, the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning the Kshirsagar,the Ocean of Milk. The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirsagar. The samudra manthan commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. Vishnu incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise, and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. Vasuki, the great venom-spewing serpent, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lak\u1e63m\u012b, the daughter of Bhrigu and Khyaati. The last to come up was the Amrita. The avatar of Kurma, the tortoise, ended with this. Vishnu then took up the form of a beautiful maiden to distract the asuras and gave immortality to the devas. She is &#8216;shakti-roopa&#8217; of &#8216;parabrahma&#8217; or &#8216;adi dev narayan&#8217; in the &#8216;Mahalak\u1e63m\u012b&#8217; story. OLak\u1e63m\u012b the goddess of misfortune, is Lak\u1e63m\u012b&#8217;s elder sister, her alter image. Lak\u1e63m\u012b is called Shree or Thirumagal because she is endowed with six auspicious and divine qualities, or Gunas, and also because she is the source of strength even to Vishnu. She is commonly portrayed as a beautiful woman, standing on a lotus flower.
