On this auspicious day, many divine pairs like Radha Krishna, Shiva Parvati, and Lakshmi Narayan are worshipped along with the moon and are offered flowers and kheer (sweet dish made of rice and milk). Deities in temples are usually dressed in white colour signifying the brightness of the moon. Many people observe full day fasting on this day. This day is celebrated differently in different parts of the country. In Odisha, on this day unmarried women keep fast with the popular belief of getting their suitable groom(kumara). This festival starts with maidens welcoming the sun god just at sunrise with a coconut-leaf-made-vessel called &#8216;kula&#8217; filled with fried paddy containing 7 fruits like coconut, banana, cucumber, betel nut, sugar-cane, guava followed by &#8216;Aarti&#8217;. In the evening they break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy of the morning along with the fruits, curd, and jaggery to offer the moon god before the &#8216;tulsi&#8217; plant. After this maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon. In many parts of Gujarat, Garba (a form of dance) takes place in the presence of moonlight. The Kojagari Purnima concerns the observance of the Kojagara Vrata. People perform this Vrata under the moonlight after fasting for the day. Lakshmi, the Hindu Goddess of Wealth, is significantly worshipped on this day as it is believed to be her birthday. Lord Indra, the God of Rains, along with his elephant Airavata is also worshipped. It is believed that on the night of Sharad Purnima, the raas (a form of dance) of Radha Krishna also takes place along with their gopis.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Kumartuli artisans making Laxmi Pot or Laxmi Sora after Durga Puja in Kolkata\" class=\"wp-image-212\" srcset=\"http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, http:\/\/sukanta-pal.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Kumartuli-artisans-making-Laxmi-Pot-or-Laxmi-Sora-after-Durga-Puja-in-Kolkata.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Kumartuli artisans making Laxmi Pot or Laxmi Sora after Durga Puja in Kolkata.
