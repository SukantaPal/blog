										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-text-align-justify">In my childhood, I didn&#8217;t know about kashful stories or association with Durga Puja, so it was ignored, only I noticed a kashful nearby idol when it’s decked up and ready for Puja. During Autumn&#8217;s season when I used to go to school, the most preferred and best transport was cycling and walking. My School was situated beside the river. While I was travelling for school this Autumn Season and in other seasons also I saw White grass around the bank of the river and a corner of different portions. That time I didn&#8217;t feel about Kashful, maybe no one told me or I experienced such nostalgic and aesthetic pleasure of it. I can see every day lots of kashful around me but I never that label of interest to go closer and bring it to my home. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the biggest reasons was that time Internet was not available or a device to access it, yes I’m talking about that era, now when I look back that was a time when I spent the most time with nature and observing each and every movement. At that time I didn&#8217;t know about photography or filmmaking, I basically didn&#8217;t have access to cameras, most of my time was spent with nature and offline with friends and alone. When I look back I’m so happy, because of that I developed a different connection with nature and human beings around us. See here I want to know everything not just specific nature or human beings, most observations or would say priority first was nature then human, and others. Now I have learned, watched, listened to and connected lots of stories and linked with Durga puja. It gives me goosebumps. In a way, I experienced all of the things before knowing it, which gives me enough joy and want to explore or picturise it in my way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now I know everything like Satyajit Ray’s film Pather Panchali Trail line scene where apu and Durga, Rabindra Sangeet and others Pujor gaan, Autumn season, Ma Asche and many more. All of the things are now visualised with what I’m seeing, basically kashful photos or footage I saw everywhere along with a Durga idol or related to Durga puja. It’s very fascinating to me believe it or not I never touch kashful by hand, and always wanted that experience. To be very honest without education and knowledge I never given importance to kashful, most ignored that time like background dancer. Childhood ignorance or without proper knowledge, after knowing the fact I missed a lot and want to experience it all over again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">That journey was very memorable when I’m into filmmaking, photography, design and many other creative fields, because of this I have friends who also want to document or explore Kashful in a different way. At that time one of the popular social media was Facebook, we saw lots of friends updating their profile with Kashful and travelling to the land of Kash. During the Autumn season in the year of 2016 (Durga Puja), we first time travelling <strong>Palla Road</strong> nearby Bardhaman for Kashful. What an experience and journey started. That time I don’t have DSLR Camera only have Apple iPad Air 2 Device.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">I used my iPad as a Camera and clicked lots of photos and some videos. I snapped lots of photos reason was I don’t know or have too much information, I should document everything so that later on I can reconnect and understand better way. In that mindset I was not photographing, I was documenting without knowing it. That’s why clicked lots of photos, now I think if I added every photo it looks like a video, because a very short period of time I snapped more photos, afraid of, If I missed anything or if the photo was not clicked or different thoughts keep in mind, looks like burst mode I used manually. That’s the reason I have backed memories and reconnect or study my activities very well and share photos in my blog. That habit helped me fall in love with the documentation in the research field. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most important things was that time I wanted to make a film about my journey and upload it to YouTube, At that time I don’t know about anything like VLOGS (not popular or people don’t know about it), travel Videos and so on. Even though vlogs were not popular in India and other countries as well, few people are actually doing it. We prefer that time blogging only. There was no plan that I want to make videos of kashful or film documentation, it was only planned was photographing, kashful that’s enough for excitement and closer looks and of course touch the kashful. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">During the journey, lots of things happened and then started filming it, small things like inside train and basic shots. When we reached Palla Road we take Groupie for Facebook, for blog and documenting memories. Then the process started when can we see kashful we’re almost there. Looks like I can’t describe that process, I will add a Podcast episode in future here.</p>
